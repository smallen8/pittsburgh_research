Where should Zack and I live in Pittsburgh? Web scrape various sites to get information on different neighborhoods and compare!
- niche
- walk score

Wants:
- neighborhood that is close to the city and/or close to where I'll work
- ability to commute to work via bus or bike (being able to walk to work would be even better!)
- somewhere where lots of young people live
- walking distance to coffeeshops, restaurants, a library, a grocery store (bonus if we can walk to church and work)
